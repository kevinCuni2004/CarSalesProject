# CarSalesProject
1st Year Computer Science, Module Introduction to Programming Project

This project was worth 60% of the module and I managed to get 95% with it. The requirements are as below:

  -5%: Looping Menu with 3 main actions: View Cars Stock, Buy Cars, View Sales Data
    
    Note: A Car is defined by its price and model
  
  -5%: Must contain at least three arrays to cars information (maximum of 10 Car models)
  
    --Two for recording the price and name of a car
    
    --One for recording the remaining amount of each car model
    
  -5%: View Cars Stock will show a list of models and remaining amount
  
  -4%: Sorted by remaining amount in descending order
  
  -10%: Buying Cars needs to record the total price/customer name/customer age/if discount was given/discount value/number of cars and update existing car arrays as necessary once a sale is concluded
  
  -4%: Any data being accepted from the keyboard needs to be validated and filtered (i.e. only accept correct data from the customer and keep asking until correct data is entered)
  
  -10%: Sales Data for a Car Model is also displayed as a total sum for each model, in addition to displaying what each customer bought
  
  -10%: Sorted by total sale amount in descending order
  
  -10%: Sales Data is to be stored in a file
  
  -10%: When the program launches, it should read previous sales data from the file, if it exists, to be used as initial data
  
  -2%: Exiting the software thanks the customer for using it before closing
  
  -15%: Make use of topics not taught in the module, but can be applied in a relevant way to this software project (do not include features/topics just for the sake of showing that you know how to use/implement it, instead consider why it will improve the software for the user) - e.g. struct
   
  -5%: Your code needs to follow recommended coding standards and good practice (see Week 2)
  
  -5%: Also submit a Logbook detailing your engagement with the Pluralsight platform, including your Pluralsight C exam (test) results.
